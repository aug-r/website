# aug_r Website

This repo is designed to hold the source code of the aug_r website. 

The website will be architected as a fully client side rendered and routed web app, with a simple REST API backend. The frontend will be written in React with React Router for routing, and will use styles from MaterializeCSS. The backend will be written in Express.js with a MongoDB database, for maximum flexibility and ease of iteration.
